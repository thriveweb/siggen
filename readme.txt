Instructions to make signature:

* Choose your layout template. (Note: Some templates might not display every field)
* Choose your theme colour.
* Choose your signature logo, as well as the logo ratio to help it look the best it can.
* Fill out the fields with your information.
* For fields you don't want or need, just leave them blank and they won't show on your signature.
* Choose which social medias you want to display.

Instructions to use signature:

After you have filled out the form and like the way it looks, go to the post link to view the signature. To get the signature from that page to your email follow the steps below.

The basic procedure that works in most email clients is:

* View the signature in your browser. You must use Chrome.
* Click in the browser window and select All (Cmd + A) (Ctrl + A on windows).
* Copy (Cmd + C) (Ctrl + C on windows) the signature.
* Open up your email client and navigate to the signatures section in your settings.
* Click in the signature editing window.
* Select all (Cmd + A) (Ctrl + A on windows) to clear and Paste (Cmd + V) (Ctrl + V on windows).
* Save changes.
* Apple mail may look like it has broken images in the preview but it will still work normally.

Note: Steps may vary depending on your Email client. Google "How to add an email signature with *Insert email client here*"
